# simulation-GUI
A PyQt example GUI for running simulation scripts and analyzing simulation generated data.

GUI is composed of two components:
1) the "RUN" tab where the user can choose the values of input parameters and run external simulation scripts (code in Run folder).
2) the "ANALYZE" tab where the user can visualize the simulation-generated data corresponding to the GUI-selected input parameters for the simulations (code in Analyze folder).

Both components have a Model-View-Controll architecture. Models are communicating with the databases (positioned in the Databases folder), whose rows correspond to simulation runs and columns to input parameters and file_name of the simulation generated data file. In this example the data is just a list of 2D data points (x,y), which are generated by the simulation.py script. The simulation script is positioned in the Simulation folder, together with the folder Simulation_data which holds data files.
